# To do

[X] Testing in FF
[X] Does "Enable debug mode" work
[X] Instructions for required GitHub PAT scopes.
[ ] Update architecture document
[ ] Is it possible to integrate a context menu with the bookmark folder directly? And, can I visually distinguish a live folder from a regular one?
[ ] GitHub oAuth2 support
[ ] Smart title generation
[ ] MAYBE: Context menu (only works in bookmark manager)
