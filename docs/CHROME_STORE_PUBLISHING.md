zip -r ../live-folders-extension-v1.1.0.zip .

# Upload to Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard
# Updates usually review faster than initial submissions
```

### 7.2 Version Management

- **Increment version numbers** properly (semantic versioning)

- **Write clear release notes** for users

## Troubleshooting

### Common Submission Issues

#### "Screenshots rejected"

- Use correct dimensions (1280x800 or 640x400)
- Show actual extension functionality
