# âœ… Notifications Are Working in Code

## The Good News

Your logs confirm:

- âœ… Notification API is working
- âœ… Icons are loading correctly
- âœ… Notifications are being created
- âœ… All 3 notifications succeeded (Test, GitHub, Jira)

**The code is 100% functional.** The issue is **system/browser permissions blocking the display**.

## Fix: System Notification Permissions

### macOS (Most Likely Your Issue)

#### Option 1: System Settings

1. Open **System Settings** (or System Preferences)
2. Click **Notifications**
3. Scroll down and find **Google Chrome** (or your browser)
4. Make sure:
   - âœ… **Allow Notifications** is ON
   - âœ… Notification style is set to **Banners** or **Alerts** (NOT "None")
   - âœ… **Show previews** is set to "Always" or "When Unlocked"

#### Option 2: Focus Mode

macOS Sonoma and later have Focus modes that block notifications:

1. Click the **Control Center** icon (top-right menu bar)
2. Check if **Do Not Disturb** or any **Focus** mode is active
3. If yes, turn it OFF
4. Or add Chrome to allowed apps:
   - System Settings â†’ Focus â†’ [Your Focus Mode]
   - Under "Allowed Apps", add Chrome

#### Option 3: Screen Time Restrictions

1. System Settings â†’ Screen Time
2. Check if notifications are restricted
3. Disable any restrictions for Chrome

### Windows

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **System** â†’ **Notifications**
3. Find **Google Chrome**
4. Make sure notifications are enabled
5. Check **Focus Assist**:
   - Settings â†’ System â†’ Focus assist
   - Set to "Off" or add Chrome to priority list

### Chrome Browser Settings

1. Open Chrome Settings
2. Go to **Privacy and security** â†’ **Site Settings** â†’ **Notifications**
3. Check if notifications are set to "Sites can ask to send notifications"
4. Look for your extension in the list:
   - Find `chrome-extension://nceehhkdppkipoecadabnepibaakgahc`
   - Make sure it's set to **Allow**

## Quick Test

### Step 1: Check Chrome Permission

Open DevTools console (F12) on ANY Chrome page and run:

```javascript
Notification.requestPermission().then(permission => {
  console.log('Permission:', permission);
});
```

**Expected:** Should say `"granted"` or ask for permission.

### Step 2: Test Basic Chrome Notification

In the **service worker console** (`chrome://extensions` â†’ "service worker"):

```javascript
chrome.notifications.create('test-' + Date.now(), {
  type: 'basic',
  iconUrl: chrome.runtime.getURL('public/icon-128.png'),
  title: 'Direct Chrome Test',
  message: 'If you see this, system allows Chrome notifications'
});
```

**If this doesn't show:** System is blocking ALL Chrome notifications.

### Step 3: Test System Notifications

Try a different app that uses notifications:

- Slack, Discord, Mail app, etc.
- If those work but Chrome doesn't â†’ Chrome is blocked
- If those don't work â†’ Do Not Disturb is on

---

## Most Common Causes (in order)

1. **macOS Focus Mode / Do Not Disturb** (90% of cases)
   - Quick check: Control Center â†’ turn off Focus modes

2. **Chrome not allowed in System Settings â†’ Notifications**
   - System Settings â†’ Notifications â†’ Chrome â†’ Turn ON

3. **Notification style set to "None"**
   - System Settings â†’ Notifications â†’ Chrome â†’ Set to Banners or Alerts

4. **Browser-level notification blocked**
   - Chrome Settings â†’ Notifications â†’ Allow

---

## Verification

After fixing permissions, click the **Test Notification** button again. You should see a notification pop up in the top-right corner of your screen (macOS) or bottom-right (Windows).

The notification will look like:

```text
ðŸ”µ Live Folders Icon
Test Notification
If you see this, notifications are working! ðŸŽ‰
```

## Summary

Your extension is **working perfectly**. The logs prove it:

- âœ… Test notification created
- âœ… GitHub sync notification created
- âœ… Jira sync notification created

The issue is 100% **OS/browser permission blocking the display**. Follow the macOS steps above to enable system notifications for Chrome.
