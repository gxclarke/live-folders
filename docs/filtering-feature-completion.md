# Provider Filtering Feature - Completion

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Implemented provider-specific filtering options to give users granular control over which items are synced from GitHub and Jira providers.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Type System Updates

**File:** `src/types/provider.ts`

- Added `GitHubFilters` interface with:
  - `createdByMe?: boolean` - Include PRs created by me
  - `reviewRequests?: boolean` - Include PRs where I'm requested for review
  
- Added `JiraFilters` interface with:
  - `createdByMe?: boolean` - Include issues created by me
  - `assignedToMe?: boolean` - Include issues assigned to me

- Added `ProviderFilters` union type
- Extended `ProviderConfig` with optional `filters?: ProviderFilters` field

### 2. GitHub Provider Filtering

**File:** `src/providers/github/github-provider.ts`

**Changes to `fetchItems()` method:**

- Reads filter configuration from provider config
- Defaults both filters to `true` (all items included)
- Conditionally fetches:
  - Authored PRs (if `createdByMe` is true)
  - Review-requested PRs (if `reviewRequests` is true)
- Returns empty array if no filters are enabled
- Logs filter state for debugging

**Behavior:**

- If both filters enabled → fetches both types and deduplicates
- If only one filter enabled → fetches only that type
- If no filters enabled → returns empty list

### 3. Jira Provider Filtering

**File:** `src/providers/jira/jira-provider.ts`

**Changes to `fetchAssignedIssues()` method:**

- Reads filter configuration from provider config
- Defaults both filters to `true` (all items included)
- Builds dynamic JQL query using OR logic:
  - `reporter = {user}` (if `createdByMe` is true)
  - `assignee = {user}` (if `assignedToMe` is true)
- Handles both Cloud and Server instance types
- Returns empty array if no filters are enabled
- Logs JQL query and filter state for debugging

**Example JQL queries:**

- Both filters: `(reporter = "user123" OR assignee = "user123") AND statusCategory != Done`
- Created only: `reporter = "user123" AND statusCategory != Done`
- Assigned only: `assignee = "user123" AND statusCategory != Done`

### 4. User Interface

**File:** `src/sidepanel/views/ProvidersView.tsx`

**Added Components:**

- Filter section displayed when provider is authenticated and has a folder configured
- Provider-specific filter checkboxes:
  - **GitHub:** "Created by me" + "Review requests"
  - **Jira:** "Created by me" + "Assigned to me"

**State Management:**

- Extended `ProviderData` interface with `filters` field
- Added `handleFilterChange()` handler to update individual filter settings
- Filters loaded from storage on component mount
- Filters updated in real-time via storage change listener
- All checkboxes default to checked (true)

**UI Layout:**

```text
Provider Card
├── Enable/Disable Toggle
├── Connection Status
├── Folder Selection
├── Sort Order Dropdown
├── **Filter Options** (NEW)
│   ├── "Filter Items" label
│   └── Provider-specific checkboxes
├── Last Sync Info
└── Sync/Connect Buttons
```

**Styling:**

- Compact checkboxes (`size="small"`)
- Disabled when provider is not enabled
- 0.5 spacing between checkboxes for clean layout

## Technical Implementation

### Filter Storage Pattern

Filters are stored in the provider's config object:

```typescript
{
  config: {
    enabled: true,
    folderId: "123",
    sortOrder: "alphabetical",
    filters: {
      createdByMe: true,
      reviewRequests: true,
      // or for Jira:
      // createdByMe: true,
      // assignedToMe: true
    }
  }
}
```

### Default Behavior

All filters default to `true` (enabled) via nullish coalescing:

```typescript
const includeCreatedByMe = filters?.createdByMe ?? true;
```

This ensures backward compatibility - existing installations without filter config will include all items.

### Filter Persistence

Uses the spread operator pattern to preserve all existing config:

```typescript
const updatedData = {
  ...providerData,
  config: {
    ...providerData.config,
    filters: {
      ...(providerData.config?.filters || {}),
      [filterKey]: value,
    },
  },
};
```

## User Experience

1. **Setup:** After connecting a provider and selecting a folder, filter checkboxes appear
2. **Defaults:** All filters start checked (include everything)
3. **Customization:** Uncheck filters to exclude certain item types
4. **Sync:** Click "Sync Now" to apply filter changes
5. **Visibility:** Only relevant items appear in bookmarks based on active filters

## Testing Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Linting passes (1 file auto-fixed)
- [x] Extension builds successfully
- [ ] GitHub filters work correctly:
  - [ ] "Created by me" includes/excludes authored PRs
  - [ ] "Review requests" includes/excludes review-requested PRs
  - [ ] Both filters combine results with deduplication
- [ ] Jira filters work correctly:
  - [ ] "Created by me" includes/excludes created issues
  - [ ] "Assigned to me" includes/excludes assigned issues
  - [ ] Both filters use OR logic in JQL query
- [ ] Filters persist across browser sessions
- [ ] Unchecking all filters returns empty list
- [ ] Filter changes trigger re-sync correctly

## Files Modified

1. `src/types/provider.ts` - Type definitions
2. `src/providers/github/github-provider.ts` - GitHub filtering logic
3. `src/providers/jira/jira-provider.ts` - Jira filtering logic
4. `src/sidepanel/views/ProvidersView.tsx` - Filter UI

**Total Changes:**

- 4 files modified
- ~150 lines added
- Type-safe filtering system
- Provider-agnostic architecture (easy to extend to future providers)

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:

- State-based filters (e.g., "Draft PRs", "In Progress issues")
- Date range filters (e.g., "Updated in last 7 days")
- Label/tag filters
- Custom JQL input for advanced Jira users
- Filter presets/templates
