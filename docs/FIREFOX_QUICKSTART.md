# ü¶ä Firefox Testing - Quick Start

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready to test  
**Firefox Support:** Enabled

---

## Quick Commands

### Test in Firefox (Development)

```bash
npm run dev:firefox
```

**What this does:**

1. Builds the extension
2. Patches manifest for Firefox compatibility
3. Launches Firefox with extension loaded
4. Auto-reloads on file changes

**You should see Firefox open with:**

- Extension installed as temporary add-on
- Debugging page at `about:debugging`
- Extension icon in toolbar

### Build for Firefox (Production)

```bash
npm run build:firefox
```

**Output:** `artifacts/live_folders-1.0.0.xpi`

---

## What Was Fixed

### ‚úÖ Service Worker ‚Üí Scripts Array

Firefox doesn't support `background.service_worker` yet. The build process automatically converts it to `scripts` array.

### ‚úÖ Removed Unsupported Features

- `sidePanel` permission (not in Firefox)
- `contentSettings` permission (not needed)
- `side_panel` field (Chrome-only)

### ‚úÖ Added Firefox Settings

- `browser_specific_settings` with extension ID
- Minimum Firefox version: 109.0

## Known Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Side Panel Button

---

## Debugging

### Check if Extension Loaded

1. Firefox should auto-open to: `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Look for "Live Folders" in the list
3. Click "Inspect" to see background console

### View Console Logs

Background script console shows:

- Sync operations
- Authentication flows
- Notification attempts
- Any errors

### Common Issues

**Extension doesn't load:**

- Check console output when running `npm run dev:firefox`
- Look for manifest errors
- Verify Firefox version ‚â• 109.0

**OAuth fails:**

- Firefox has stricter redirect URI requirements
- Check console for redirect errors
- May need to update `auth-manager.ts`
